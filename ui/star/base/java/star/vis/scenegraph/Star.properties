DrawableSession$RendererConnection.field.ADHOC=Ad hoc Service
DrawableSession$RendererConnection.field.DEDICATED=Dedicated Service
DrawableSession$RendererConnection.field.LOCAL=Local
DrawableSession$RendererConnection.field.SERVER=Server
DrawableSession$UserMessages.field.HARDCOPY_SCALED_DDDD=Hardcopy scaled up to requested resolution %1$dx%2$d from %3$dx%4$d, due to limitations of the graphics sub-system.
DrawableSession$UserMessages.field.LIC_RESOLUTION_EXCEEDED=Vector displayer with LIC at high resolutions may exceed graphics hardware memory. Please lower the resolution to <\= 4096 pixels, or enforce Mesa OpenGL.
DrawableSession.field.CONNECTING_SSH_TUNNEL=Connecting SSH tunnel for remote rendering.
DrawableSession.field.CREATE_RENDERER_ERROR=Unable to instantiate %s.\nRenderer Host\: %s\nPort\: %d\n\nLocal rendering will be used as a fallback.\nPotential causes for this problem are\:\n-Rendering service unreachable\n-Version mismatch between renderer and client
DrawableSession.field.INVALID_RENDERER_PORT_ERROR=No valid port has been specified for the rendering service. \nLocal rendering will be used as a fallback.
DrawableSession.field.REMOTE_RENDERER_INFO=Using renderer on %s\:%d
SsgProcessor.field.NO_NATIVE_LIBRARIES=Installation error\: can not load client native libraries\: %s
ViewObjectRenderer$RendererMessage.field.HARDWARE_NOT_SUPPORTED=Error\: Hardware does not fulfill all requirements for rendering the view of "%s". Please consult the documentation for more information.
ViewObjectRenderer$RendererMessage.field.NONE=
ViewObjectRenderer$RendererMessage.field.OUT_OF_GPU_MEMORY=Error\: "%s" GPU memory requirement exceeds available memory of the hardware on which the renderer is currently located.\nIf possible, save the current simulation and restart the application. This will free the GPU memory.\nPrior to opening the Scene again, try to reduce the number of objects that are displayed. This can be achieved, for example, by reducing the number of input parts.\nFor more detailed information on memory consumption, please consult the Studio Scene user guide.\nIf running a simulation using GPGPU hardware (-gpgpu option), it is possible that a memory conflict can occur due to sharing GPU resources with the solver.
ViewObjectRenderer$RendererMessage.field.UNKNOWN_ERROR=Error\: An unexpected error occured while trying to display "%s". Please save your work and restart the application. If the problem persists, please contact your dedicated support engineer.
ViewObjectRenderer.field.ADV_REND_HARDCOPY_EST_FAIL=unknown (need to render scene at least once in order to compute)
ViewObjectRenderer.field.ADV_REND_HARDCOPY_STARTED=Advanced rendered hardcopy started\: estimated time \= %1$s
ViewObjectRenderer.field.ADV_REND_PROGRESSIVE_TIME=Advanced Rendering\: estimated time left \= %1$s
ViewObjectRenderer.field.FRAME_RENDER_TIME=frame render time \= %05.0f ms (fps \= %05.1f) input latency \= %05.0f ms
ViewObjectRenderer.field.HARDCOPY_ABORTED_FORM=File %1$s is not writable, hardcopy aborted.
ViewObjectRenderer.field.HARDCOPY_TOO_LARGE=Image size (resolution x magnification) for Scene %1$s is too large, hardcopy aborted.
ViewObjectRenderer.field.IMAGE_EXPORT_MSG=Exporting "%1$s" to "%2$s"...
ViewObjectRenderer.field.IMAGE_EXPORT_OK="%s" exported to "%s"
